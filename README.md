# Hangman Game

A simple text-based Hangman game built with Python. The game randomly selects a word and allows the player to guess letters. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before they lose. The game displays a visual representation of the hangman as the player progresses.

## Features
- Randomly chooses a word from a list of words.
- Displays the progress of the playerâ€™s guesses.
- Shows a hangman figure that updates with each wrong guess.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Python code, suitable for beginners.

## Game Rules
1. You are presented with a series of blanks representing the letters in a hidden word.
2. You guess letters one by one.
3. If your guess is correct, the blank(s) for that letter will be filled in.
4. If your guess is wrong, a part of the hangman is drawn, and you lose one life.
5. You have 6 lives. If you guess the word before running out of lives, you win.
6. If you lose all your lives, the game ends, and the hangman is fully drawn.
